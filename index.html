                    <p class="passage1">Welcome to my portfolio website! Currently, I am teaching math to elementary, junior
                        high, senior high shcool students. Especially I'm an
                        expert on college enterance test such as SAT and ACT. I have taught students for 7 years since I
                        graduated high school.</p>
                    <p class="passage2">My most challenging part from "Get Your Mind Right" is 7. Find a Squad. I have two
                        reasons why making friends is challenging to me. The first reason is I have immigrated in United States
                        of America few years ago. I am not a native speaker in English. Of course, I do speak in English, but I
                        am not used to America culture like sports, TV shows and things that make closed to each other with
                        America culture. The second reasons is that I like doing works alone. I feel comfortable and I have
                        accomplishment when I work and finish my job alone. I teach students and I have taught students for 8
                        years. Teaching skills does not require team work. So team work is my challenging skill to me.
                        To overcome this difficulty, I have to feel the need to have team work for projects. Actually I feel
                        the need and I am willing to have companies for helping and working together.
                    </p>
                    <p class="passage3">Write 100 words about what these skills will do for your career! : Honestly I have no idea
                        how to apply these skills to new career yet. I researched about many different position and types of
                        jobs but I cannot imagine the jobs and how to work yet because this field is totally different with my
                        job. But I will figure it out!!!</p>
